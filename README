tokenorder is an experiment that tries to represent comments
as state transitions in the go parser, via pairs of ast.Node.
It is adapted from gotype

Right now, all it does is parse the example files and spit out
which pairs of ast.Node comments lie between and has some rudimentary
logic for manipulating and re-anchoring the ASTs. In its current form, it exists mostly
for the purposes of discussion.
